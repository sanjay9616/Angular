<h1>Different Types of Angular CLI Commands</h1>

There are three types of Angular CLI commands

<h2>1. Schematics Commands</h2>

Schematics commands are based on a tool called Schematics that comes from the `@angular-devkit/schematics package`. Schematics is the underlying tool the Angular CLI uses to scaffold a new Angular workspace (ng new), generate blueprints (ng generate), update/migrate existing code (ng update), and add some frameworks support to an Angular application (ng add). It's all about code generation.

**examples** - `ng new, ng add, ng generate, ng update` etc

<h3>ng add <collection>:</h3>

Adds the npm package for a published library to your workspace, and configures the project in the current working directory to use that library, as specified the library's schematic.  For example, adding @angular/pwa configures your project for PWA support: `ng add @angular/pwa`

<h3>ng new [name] or ng n [name]:</h3>

Creates and initializes a new Angular application that is the default project for a new workspace.

Provides interactive prompts for optional configuration, such as adding routing support. All prompts can safely be allowed to default.

<h3>ng generate <schematic>:</h3>

Generates and/or modifies files based on a schematic, This command has the following sub-commands.

`ng generate component [name]` or `ng generate c [name]`: Creates a new, generic component definition in the given project.

`ng generate class [name]` or `ng generate cl [name]`: Creates a new, generic class definition in the given project.

`ng generate application [name]` or `ng generate app [name]`: Generates a new basic application definition in the "projects" subfolder of the workspace.

**and other sub-commands mentioned below:**

`ng generate directive [name] / ng generate d [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate guard [name] / ng generate g [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate interceptor [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate module [name] / ng generate m [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate pipe [name] / ng generate p [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate service [name] / ng generate s [name]`, `ng generate app-shell`, &nbsp; `ng generate config [type]`, &nbsp; `ng generate enum [name] / ng generate e [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate environments`, &nbsp; `ng generate interface [name] [type] / ng generate i [name] [type]`, &nbsp; `ng generate library [name] / ng generate lib [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate resolver [name] / ng generate r [name]`, &nbsp; `ng generate service-worker`, &nbsp; `ng generate web-worker [name]`

<h3>ng update [packages..]</h3>

Updates your workspace and its dependencies. For example - `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`, and `ng update @angular/cli@^10 @angular/core@^10`

<h2>2. Architect Commands:</h2>

Architect commands are based on a tool called Architect that is published under the `@angular-devkit/architect` package name. Architect helps the Angular CLI lint (ng lint), test (ng test, ng e2e), serve (ng serve), build (ng build), and deploy (ng deploy) our Angular applications. It's all about running complex tasks.

**examples** - `ng build, ng deploy, ng e2e, ng lint, ng run, ng serve, ng test,ng xi18n` etc

**ng serve [project] or ng s [project]**: Builds and serves your application, rebuilding on file changes.

**ng run <target>**: Runs an Architect target with an optional custom builder configuration defined in your project.

**ng build [project] or ng b [project]**: Compiles an Angular application or library into an output directory named dist/ at the given output path.

**ng test [project] or ng t [project]**: Runs unit tests in a project.

**ng deploy [project]**: The command takes an optional project name, as specified in the projects section of the angular.json workspace configuration file. When a project name is not supplied, executes the deploy builder for the default project.

To use the ng deploy command, use ng add to add a package that implements deployment capabilities to your favorite platform. Adding the package automatically updates your workspace configuration, adding a deployment CLI builder. For example:

```ts
"projects": {
  "my-project": {
    ...
    "architect": {
      ...
      "deploy": {
        "builder": "@angular/fire:deploy",
        "options": {}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<h2>3. Native Commands:</h2>

Native commands are general Angular CLI commands. They are native to the Angular CLI in the sense that they don't rely on other tools/packages to be executed. Displaying our packages' versions (ng version), opening the official documentation (ng doc), reading and setting some values in the angular.json file (ng config), or displaying the list of available commands and their description (ng help) do not require the use of any specific tool.

**examples** - `ng config,ng doc,ng version, ng analytics, ng help` etc
