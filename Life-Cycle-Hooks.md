<h1>Component Life Cycle Hooks</h1>

Angular has 8 lifecycle hooks that help us in every situation where we would like to write some code on a specific event.

- Each interface has a single hook method whose name is the interface name plus prefixed with ng. So, before using the interface method, we must have to implement the respective interface.
- For example, the OnChange interface has a hook method named ngOnChange() that Angular calls shortly after creating the component. Evermore, itâ€™s required to import SimpleChanges for the OnChange method only.

<h2>1. ngOnChanges()</h2> - https://www.stackchief.com/blog/ngOnChanges%20Example%20%7C%20Angular

- ngOnChanges called before `ngOnInit()` and whenever one/more data-bound input properties change.
- It means, whenever any `@input` decorator changed `from the parent component than` the code under this function will be triggered.
- Whenever any `@output` decorator changed from the child component than the code under this `function will not be triggered`.
- This means if you don't have any `@Input` properties on a child, ngOnChanges will never get called.
- Itâ€™s required to import SimpleChanges for the OnChange method only.
