<h1>Angular Decorators</h1>

In Angular, a decorator is a function that adds metadata to a class, its members, or its method arguments. Decorators are a way to extend the functionality of a class, method, or property by attaching additional features or behaviors to them.

There are four main types that are used to provide additional information about a class or its members:

- **Class decorators**, e.g. `@Component` and `@NgModule`
- **Property decorators** for properties inside classes, e.g. `@Input` and `@Output`
- **Method decorators** for methods inside classes, e.g. `@HostListener`
- **Parameter decorators** for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. `@Injectable`

<h2>@Component</h2>

The `@Component` decorator is used to define a component in an Angular application. It takes an object with various properties, such as the component's template, style, and selector, as an argument.

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-pr-dashboard',
    templateUrl: './pr-dashboard.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./pr-dashboard.component.scss']
})
export class PrDashboardComponent implements OnInit {}
```

In this example, the `@Component` decorator is applied to the PrDashboardComponent class, which defines a component with an `app-pr-dashboard` selector and a simple template.

<h2>@Input</h2>

The `@Input` decorator is used to bind a component's input property to a value that is passed from its parent component.

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
    @input() message: string;
}
```

In this example, the `@Input` decorator is applied to the message property of the ChildComponent class, which indicates that the message property can be bound to a value passed from the parent component.

<h2>@HostListener</h2>

The `@HostListener` decorator in Angular is a function that allows you to bind a host element event to a component method. It is used to listen for events that are triggered on the host element, such as mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.

```ts
import { HostListener, Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `<h1>Hello, you have pressed enter {{counter}} number of times!</h1>
  Press enter key to increment the counter.
  <button (click)="resetCounter()">Reset Counter</button>`
})
class AppComponent {
  counter = 0;
  @HostListener('window:keydown.enter', ['$event'])
  handleKeyDown(event: KeyboardEvent) {
    this.counter++;
  }
  resetCounter() {
    this.counter = 0;
  }
}
```

The above example registers another DOM event handler that listens for Enter key-press events on the global window.

<h2>@Injectable</h2>

The @Injectable decorator is used to define a service in an Angular application. It indicates that the service can be injected into other components or services.

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {
    // service class goes here
}
```

In this example, the @Injectable decorator is applied to the MyService class, which defines a service that can be injected into other components or services.

<h2>Create a Custom Decorator</h2>

To create a custom decorator, you can define a function that takes the target class or its member as an argument and then adds the desired behavior or metadata. Here's an example of a custom decorator that logs a message when a method is called:
