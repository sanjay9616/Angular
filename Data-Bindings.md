<h1>Data Bindings in Angular</h1>

Angular provides three categories of data binding according to the direction of data flow:

<h2>1. From source to view</h2>

```ts
// SOURCE
value: string = 'From source to view data binding';
```
```html
<!-- VIEW -->
<h1>{{value}}</h1>
```

<h2>2. From view to source</h2>

```html
<!-- VIEW -->
<input type="text" (input)="onInputChange($event)">
```
```ts
// SOURCE
value: string = ''
onInputChange(value: string) {
    this.value = value
}
```

<h2>3. In a two-way sequence of view to source to view</h2>

```html
<!-- VIEW -->
<input type="text" (input)="onInputChange($event)">
<h1>{{value}}</h1>
```
```ts
// SOURCE
value: string = ''
onInputChange(value: string) {
    this.value = value
}
```
<h3>Other types of data bindings</h3>

**One-way Binding:**

One-way data binding in Angular (i.e. unidirectional binding) is a way to bind data from the component to the view (DOM) or vice versa - from view to the component. It is used to display information to the end-user which automatically stays synchronized with each change of the underlying data. This is similar to the one-way binding in WPF.

**Two-way Binding:**

Two-way binding gives components in your application a way to share data. Use two-way binding to listen for events and update values simultaneously between parent and child components.

**Interpolation:**

Data binding using double curly braces {{ }} data moves in one way from source to view.

```html
<h3>Current customer: {{ currentCustomer }}</h3>
```

**Property Binding:**

Property binding using square brackets [] and value in one direction, from a component's property into a target element property.

```html
<button [disabled]="isDisabled">Property Binding</button>
```

**Event Binding:**

Event binding lets you listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, clicks, and touches.

```html
<button (click)="onSave()">Save</button>
```

**Class Binding:** `[class.sale]="true/false"`,  `[class]="my-class-1 my-class-2 my-class-3"`

**Style Binding:** `[style.width]="100px"`, `[style.width.px]="100"`

**Attrinute Binding:** `<p [attr.attribute-you-are-targeting]="expression"></p>`, `[attr.colspan]="1 + 1"`
