<h1>Difference between ng-template, ng-container, ng-content, and ngTemplateOutlet</h1>

<h2>1. ng-container</h2>

- `ng-container` is a non-rendered container element that allows you to group elements in a template and doesn‚Äôt interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn‚Äôt put it in the DOM
- This is helpful if you don‚Äôt want any extra div on DOM, you can simply use ng-container. For eg: If there are two structural directives being called on one div as below:

```html
<div *ngIf="details" *ngFor="let info of details">
  {{ info.content }}
</div>
```

Attempting to compile this code will result in the following error:

`Can't have multiple template bindings on one element. Use only one attribute prefixed with *`

One workaround would be to separate the bindings as below:

```html
<div *ngIf="details">
  <div *ngFor="let info of details">
    {{ info.content }}
  </div>
</div>
```

Or we can use <ng-container> without adding any extra element to the DOM at runtime:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="details">
  <div *ngFor="let info of details">
    {{ info.content }}
  </div>
</ng-container>
```

<h2>2. ng-template</h2>

As the name suggests the <ng-template> is a template element that Angular uses with structural directives ( *ngIf, *ngFor, [ngSwitch], and custom directives). These template elements only work in the presence of structural directives, which help us to define a template that doesn‚Äôt render anything by itself, but conditionally renders them to the DOM. It helps us create dynamic templates that can be customized and configured.

```html
<div>
   Ng-template Content
   <div *ngIf=‚Äùfalse else showNgTemplateContent‚Äù>
      Shouldn't be displayed
   </div>
</div>

<ng-template #showNgTemplateContent>
    Should be displayed
</ng-template>
```
In the above example, If the condition is false then we will show the text as `Shouldn't be displayed` else will show ng-template content as `Should be displayed`

<h2>3. ng-content</h2>

ng-content is used to project content into Angular components. You use the <ng-content></ng-content> tag as a placeholder for that dynamic content, then when the template is parsed Angular will replace that placeholder tag with your content.

For example, you have two components as parent and child component and want to show some data in the child component from the parent component

In parent.component.html <app-child> selector is used to show data of the child component

```html
<app-child>
  <div> Child Component Details </div>
</app-child>
```

If you check on your browser <div>Child Component Details</div> inside
<app-child></app-child> would not be visible. What if we want to show this content? So this is where the ng-content directive comes into the picture. What we need to do is, just add ‚Äúng-content‚Äù inside the component template and it will find the content inside the directive tag and add it to that template at that particular place where we added the ‚Äúng-content‚Äù tag.

So instead of div, you do something similar with Angular components except you tell Angular where to display it in the parent template using ng-content.

In child.component.html:

```html
<h1>Child Info</h1>
<ng-content></ng-content>
```

**Multiple ng-content**

```html
<!-- parent component -->
<app-child>
  <div class="first"> Child Component First Details </div>
  <div class="second"> Child Component Second Details </div>
</app-child>
```
```html
<!-- child component -->
<h1>Child Info</h1>
<ng-content select=".first"></ng-content>
<ng-content select=".second"></ng-content>
```
`Output`

```html
<!-- child component -->
<h1>Child Info</h1>
<div class="first"> Child Component First Details </div>
<div class="second"> Child Component Second Details </div>
```

<h2>4. ngTemplateOutlet</h2>

- In the world of web development, being able to change the look and feel of a page on the fly is crucial. You want your app to be responsive to user interactions and data changes. That‚Äôs where Angular‚Äôs `ng-template` and `ngTemplateOutlet` come to the rescue.
- The `ngTemplateOutlet` directive allows you to render different templates dynamically based on conditions or data, making your templates more flexible and reusable.

```html
<ng-template #hip>
  <p>Hip!</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template #hooray>
  <p>Hooray!</p>
</ng-template>
```
```html
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="myTemplate;context:MyContext"></ng-container>
```
- `myTemplate` is the reference to the template you defined.
- `myContext` is an optional context object that can be used to pass data to the template.
- when the `ng-template` is rendered inside the `ng-container`, it will have access to the data variable, and you can use it within the template to display the passed data.

```html
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="hip;context:MyContext"></ng-container>
```
**Example**

```html
<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="selectedCompaignType"></ng-container>

<ng-template #banner>
  <p>Banner</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template #title>
  <p>Title</p>
</ng-template>

<ng-template #carousel>
  <p>Carousel</p>
</ng-template>
```

- In the provided code, the `selectedCampaignType` variable is used to determine which of the three templates (banner, tile, or carousel) will be dynamically rendered inside the `<ng-container>`. The content of the selected template is inserted into the `<ng-container>` using `ngTemplateOutlet`.
- For example, if `selectedCampaignType` is set to ‚Äúbanner,‚Äù the content of the ‚Äúbanner‚Äù template will be rendered inside the `<ng-container>`. Similarly, changing the value of `selectedCampaignType` will dynamically switch the content displayed within the `<ng-container`. This mechanism allows you to conditionally render different views based on the value of `selectedCampaignType`.
